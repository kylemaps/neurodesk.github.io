## What is Neurodesk?
Neurodesk provides a containerised data analysis environment to facilitate reproducible analysis of neuroimaging data. At Neurodesk, we believe that reproducibility should be a fundamental principle underlying neuroscientific data analysis (1). Analysis pipelines for neuroimaging data typically rely on specific versions of packages and software, and are dependent on their native operating system. These dependencies mean that a working analysis pipeline may fail or produce different results on a new computer, or even on the same computer after a software update. Neurodesk provides a platform in which anyone, anywhere, using any computer can reproduce your original research findings given the original data and analysis code. 

The Neurodesk environment relies on software containers and allows users to build and use containers to analyse neuroimaging data. Containers can be compared to virtual machines, in that they allow users to create a virtual, isolated computing environment with an operating system separate to that of the host machine. However, containers differ from virtual machines in that they virtualise software rather than hardware. Practically, this means that container images require few system resources to install, start-up quickly, and are easily portable between computers. 

We recommend watching [this excellent short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HelrQnm3v4g) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) on research applications of software containers.

## Background
Neurodesk originates from various projects at the Centre for Advanced Imaging that enabled running neuroimaging tools on HPCs and Linux workstations using software containers. The ideas and code from projects like ["DICOM2CLOUD"](https://github.com/CAIsr/dicom2cloud). ["transparent singularity"](https://github.com/CAIsr/transparent-singularity) and ["CAID"](https://github.com/CAIsr/caid) were combined during a [hackathon project](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/issues/177) to create a ["Virtual Neuro Machine"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FCtrRCZrj-5nLmnIIpVFYYYXuMAoUf-B/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100303589348027986473&rtpof=true&sd=true). The project was later renamed to Neurodesk and further developments were funded through the ARDC platform project "AEDAPT" with the goal to create a national platform for reproducible electrophysiology data analysis and sharing, accessible to all Australian researchers across a wide range of disciplines that conduct electrophysiological research.
